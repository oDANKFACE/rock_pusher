# Overview

This project is a low fidelity game I've developed that showcases my knowledge of Godot and the relevant concepts, including: sprites, tilemaps, cameras, node structures, collisions, and signal/connection structures.

The game itself is simply used to showcase my use of the concepts listed above. The player can be moved with arrow keys or WASD, and can traverse the map. The player can walk behind trees and cannot walk through their trunks. The player can collide with a rock and push it across the map in all directions.

The purpose of devloping this game was to exercise my skills in the Godot engine. This has helped me better understand the background concepts of game development.

# Development Environment

To develop this game I used the Godot game engine, an open-source platform commonly used by indie developers (especially in wake of the Unity debacle). Godot's tools are intuitive, yet provoke creativity.


The language used in Godot is called GDScript. It is written in a Python-esque syntax, making it both easy to read. No external libraries were used, as the Godot engine provides a comprehensive set of tools to develop the game as I did.

# Future Work
* I plan to implement the use of other animations included in the open source sprite sheet that I used, includinmg a sword swing animation.
* I will implement music to be played and looped through the game.
* I will create real goals for the player to chase, as well as end game scenarios for winning and losing.
